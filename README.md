# EXCEL-DASHBOARD-PROJECT-BLINKIT-SALES-PERFORMANCE-
ðŸš€ Blinkit Sales Analysis â€“ Excel Dashboard ðŸš€

I recently worked on creating an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze sales performance for Blinkit (India's Last Minute App).

This project helped me explore data visualization, calculations, and Power Query to generate actionable insights.

ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights of the Dashboard:
âœ… Total Sales: $1.20M with breakdown by outlet type, size, and location
âœ… KPIs Displayed: Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating
âœ… Outlet Establishment Trends: Year-wise sales growth visualization
âœ… Category Insights: Sales by Item Type, Fat Content, and Outlet Size
âœ… Location Analysis: Tier-wise outlet sales comparison
âœ… Outlet Type Analysis: Insights on Grocery Stores & Supermarket categories (sales, item count, customer ratings)

ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used:
ðŸ”¹ Excel (Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation)
ðŸ”¹ Power Query Editor (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
ðŸ”¹ Advance Functions (for Measures & KPIs)

This project enhanced my ability to transform raw data into meaningful business insights and create a dashboard that supports data-driven decision making.
